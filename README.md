# Theodoros Mangas - Software Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio website: a concise, production-minded presentation of my software engineering work, technical focus, and implementation standards.

## Focus

- Full-stack web development with Python/Django foundations
- GIS-oriented workflows and practical engineering tooling
- Clean architecture, validation-first logic, and maintainable systems
- Clear UI/UX with reliability and usability as defaults

## What This Portfolio Highlights

- Real-world projects and platform architecture decisions
- Engineering approach across backend, frontend, and data workflows
- Practical delivery standards: structure, consistency, and scalability

## Core Principles

- Clarity first: readable code, predictable behavior, and straightforward structure
- Maintainability over complexity: reusable patterns and low duplication
- Quality by default: accessibility, validation, and responsive design
- Iteration readiness: easy to update, extend, and refine over time

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Bootstrap 5
